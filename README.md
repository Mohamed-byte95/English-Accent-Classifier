# English-Accent-Classifier
Accent Analyzer Tool is a Python-based application that uses SpeechBrain and HuggingFace models to classify the English accent spoken in an audio or video clip. It extracts audio from YouTube URLs or local files, processes the speech, and predicts the most likely English accent (e.g., British, Indian, American, etc.).
